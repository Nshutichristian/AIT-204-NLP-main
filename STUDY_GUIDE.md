## üéØ Core Concepts

### What is Sentiment Analysis?

**Definition**: Automatically determining the emotional tone of text.

**Examples**:
- "This movie was great!" ‚Üí Positive
- "Waste of time." ‚Üí Negative
- "It was okay." ‚Üí Neutral

**Real-World Uses**:
- Product review analysis (Amazon, Yelp)
- Social media monitoring (Twitter sentiment)
- Customer feedback analysis
- Movie/book recommendations

### Why Multi-Scale?

**Problem with Binary** (just Positive/Negative):
- Can't express neutrality
- Can't express intensity ("good" vs "amazing")
- Forces nuanced opinions into boxes

**Solution: Multi-Scale** (-3 to +3):
- Captures neutrality (0)
- Captures intensity (-3 vs -1, +1 vs +3)
- More human-like expression

**Research**: Google "likert scale sentiment analysis"

## üîÑ Binary vs Multi-Class Classification

### Binary Classification

**Definition**: Classify into 2 categories

**Example**:
```python
Input: "Amazing movie!"
Output: [0.05, 0.95]  # 5% negative, 95% positive
Prediction: Positive
```

**Limitations**:
- Only 2 choices
- No middle ground
- Can't distinguish intensity

### Multi-Class Classification

**Definition**: Classify into 3+ categories

**Example**:
```python
Input: "Amazing movie!"
Output: [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.15, 0.70]
# Classes: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3
Prediction: +3 (Very Positive)
```

**Benefits**:
- Captures nuance
- Neutral category exists
- Intensity levels

### How It Works

**Model Architecture**:
```
Input Text
    ‚Üì
Tokenization
    ‚Üì
Transformer Encoder
    ‚Üì
Classification Head ‚Üí [7 outputs] instead of [2 outputs]
    ‚Üì
Softmax (probabilities)
    ‚Üì
Argmax (pick highest)
```

**Key Change**: Output layer has 7 nodes instead of 2!

**Research**: Google "multi-class classification neural networks"

## ü§ñ How Transformers Work

### What is a Transformer?

**Simple Explanation**:
A neural network architecture that can understand context in text by "paying attention" to all words simultaneously.

**Key Innovation: Attention Mechanism**
- Learns which words are important
- Understands relationships between words
- Processes all words in parallel (fast!)

### Example: Understanding Negation

**Text**: "This movie was not good"

**What Transformer Learns**:
```
Attention weights:
         not   good
not      0.7   0.9    ‚Üê "not" pays attention to "good"
good     0.8   0.6    ‚Üê "good" pays attention to "not"

Result: Model understands "not good" = negative
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Traditional methods: "good" = positive (wrong!)
- Transformer: "not" + "good" = negative (correct!)

### DistilBERT

**What**: Smaller, faster version of BERT

**Stats**:
- 40% smaller than BERT
- 60% faster than BERT
- 97% of BERT's accuracy

**Why Use It**:
- Faster training & inference
- Less memory required
- Still very accurate
- Great for learning!

**Research**: Google "DistilBERT explained" or read the paper

## üé® Streamlit Basics

### What is Streamlit?

**Definition**: Python library for building web apps quickly

**Philosophy**: Write Python, get web app automatically!

### Key Components

**1. Title & Text**:
```python
st.title("My App")  # Big heading
st.header("Section")  # Medium heading
st.write("Any text")  # Paragraph
st.markdown("**Bold** text")  # Markdown support
```

**2. Input Widgets**:
```python
text = st.text_input("Enter text:")  # Single line
area = st.text_area("Enter review:")  # Multi-line
choice = st.selectbox("Pick one:", ["A", "B"])  # Dropdown
clicked = st.button("Click me")  # Button
```

**3. Display Results**:
```python
st.success("‚úÖ Success")  # Green message
st.error("‚ùå Error")  # Red message
st.warning("‚ö†Ô∏è Warning")  # Yellow message
st.info("‚ÑπÔ∏è Info")  # Blue message
```

**4. Layouts**:
```python
# Columns
col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
with col1:
    st.write("Left side")
with col2:
    st.write("Right side")

# Sidebar
with st.sidebar:
    st.write("Sidebar content")
```

**5. Caching** (Important for ML!):
```python
@st.cache_resource  # Cache heavy resources like models
def load_model():
    return model  # Only loads once!
```

### Why Streamlit for ML?

**Benefits**:
- No HTML/CSS/JavaScript needed
- Perfect for data science/ML demos
- Auto-reloads on code changes
- Built-in deployment (Streamlit Cloud)

**Research**: Spend 15 minutes on https://docs.streamlit.io

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment Concepts

### Why Deploy?

**Benefits**:
- Share with others (portfolio!)
- Test with real users
- Learn production skills
- Add to resume

### Streamlit Cloud

**What**: Free hosting for Streamlit apps

**How It Works**:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect GitHub to Streamlit Cloud
3. Streamlit builds & hosts your app
4. Get public URL

**Advantages**:
- Completely free
- Automatic updates (push to GitHub = redeploy)
- Built-in SSL (HTTPS)
- Easy to use

### What Happens During Deployment?

1. **Streamlit Cloud reads your repo**
2. **Installs dependencies** from requirements.txt
3. **Downloads model** (~250MB for DistilBERT)
4. **Starts the app** on their servers
5. **Gives you a URL** to share

**First deployment**: 5-10 minutes (downloads model)
**Subsequent deployments**: 2-3 minutes (uses cache)

**Research**: Google "streamlit cloud deployment guide"

## üìñ Learning Strategies

### 1. Try Before Looking

**Strategy**: Always attempt TODOs before checking solutions

**Why**:
- Struggle = learning!
- Builds problem-solving skills
- Makes solutions stick better

**When to check solutions**:
- After genuinely trying (15+ min)
- After researching the concept
- When you're truly stuck

### 2. Research Actively

**When you don't understand something**:

1. **Read the hint** in the code comments
2. **Google it** with good keywords:
   - "python multi-class classification"
   - "streamlit text_area example"
   - "git push to github tutorial"
3. **Read documentation**:
   - https://docs.streamlit.io
   - https://huggingface.co/docs
4. **Watch a video** on YouTube
5. **Try it** in a test file

**Good research question**: "How do I create a text input in Streamlit?"
**Bad research question**: "How do I do TODO 2?"

### 3. Learn by Breaking

**Strategy**: Experiment and break things!

**Try**:
- Change `num_labels` to 5 - what happens?
- Remove the softmax - what breaks?
- Change the sentiment scale to 1-7 instead of -3 to +3

**Why**: Understanding what breaks helps you understand how it works!

### 4. Document Your Learning

**Keep notes**:
- What did TODO 1 teach you?
- Why does the conversion formula work?
- What was the hardest part?
- What would you do differently?

**Benefits**:
- Helps retention
- Great for interviews
- Builds portfolio content

### 5. Build on It

**After completing the base project**:
- Add a feature you think would be cool
- Try a different model
- Apply it to a different problem
- Teach someone else

## üêõ Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Wrong Number of Labels

**Error**:
```python
num_labels = 6  # Wrong! Forgot to count 0
```

**Why it happens**: Forgetting that -3 to +3 includes 0

**How to fix**: Count all values: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 = 7

**Lesson**: Always count carefully!

### Mistake 2: Incorrect Conversion Formula

**Error**:
```python
sentiment_score = class_id  # Wrong! Gives 0-6 instead of -3 to +3
```

**Why it happens**: Not thinking about the offset

**How to fix**: We need to shift by 3: `class_id - 3`

**Lesson**: Test with example values:
- class_id=0 ‚Üí 0-3=-3 ‚úì
- class_id=6 ‚Üí 6-3=+3 ‚úì

### Mistake 3: Unbalanced Training Data

**Error**:
```python
training_data = [
    ("Great!", 6),
    ("Amazing!", 6),
    ("Loved it!", 6),
    # Only class 6 examples!
]
```

**Why it happens**: Easier to think of extreme examples

**How to fix**: Create 2+ examples for each of the 7 classes

**Lesson**: Balanced data = better model

### Mistake 4: Not Using Session State in Streamlit

**Error**:
```python
example_text = "Some text"  # Doesn't update UI!
```

**Why it happens**: Not understanding Streamlit's execution model

**How to fix**:
```python
st.session_state.example_text = "Some text"  # Works!
```

**Lesson**: Use session_state for values that persist

### Mistake 5: Missing Dependencies in requirements.txt

**Error**: App works locally but deployment fails

**Why it happens**: Forgot to add a package to requirements.txt

**How to fix**: Make sure ALL imports are in requirements.txt

**Lesson**: Test in clean environment before deploying
