## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Required packages:**
- torch (PyTorch framework)
- transformers (Hugging Face)
- datasets (Hugging Face datasets)
- scikit-learn (metrics)
- numpy, accelerate

### Running the Code

#### Option 1: Full IMDB Dataset (Requires Network)
```bash
python imdb_sentiment_analysis.py
```
- Downloads 25K train + 25K test reviews
- Trains for 3 epochs (~1-3 hours)
- Achieves 92-94% accuracy

#### Option 2: Demo with Synthetic Data
```bash
python imdb_sentiment_demo.py
```
- Uses local synthetic dataset (4,800 train + 1,200 test)
- Trains for 2 epochs (~10-20 minutes)
- Demonstrates transformer architecture

#### Option 3: Quick Test (Small Subset)
Edit `imdb_sentiment_analysis.py`, uncomment lines 74-75:
```python
dataset['train'] = dataset['train'].select(range(1000))
dataset['test'] = dataset['test'].select(range(500))
```
Then run:
```bash
python imdb_sentiment_analysis.py
```
- Uses 1,000 train + 500 test samples
- Trains in 5-10 minutes
- Good for testing and debugging

## 📊 How It Works

### 1. **Input Processing**
```python
"This movie was fantastic!"
→ ['[CLS]', 'this', 'movie', 'was', 'fantastic', '!', '[SEP]']
→ [101, 2023, 3185, 2001, 11781, 999, 102]
```

### 2. **Embedding & Encoding**
- Each token → 768-dimensional vector
- Positional information added
- Preserves word order and meaning

### 3. **Transformer Encoding**
- **6 layers** of attention + feed-forward
- **12 attention heads** per layer
- Learns contextual relationships
- Captures negation, intensifiers, sentiment

### 4. **Classification**
```python
[CLS] representation → Linear layer → [2.3, -1.5]
                    → Softmax      → [0.92, 0.08]
                    → Prediction   → Positive (92% confident)
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Performance Metrics
```
Accuracy:  92-94%
Precision: 92-94%
Recall:    92-94%
F1 Score:  92-94%
```

### Sample Predictions
```
Input: "This movie was absolutely fantastic!"
Output: Positive 😊 (97.66% confidence)

Input: "Terrible movie, waste of time."
Output: Negative 😞 (98.45% confidence)

Input: "The acting was decent but plot was confusing."
Output: Mixed (model will predict dominant sentiment)
```

## 🔑 Key Components

### Model Architecture
- **Base**: DistilBERT (distilled BERT)
- **Parameters**: ~66 million
- **Layers**: 6 transformer encoder blocks
- **Attention Heads**: 12 per layer
- **Hidden Size**: 768
- **Vocabulary**: 30,522 WordPiece tokens

### Training Configuration
```python
learning_rate = 2e-5
batch_size = 8
epochs = 3
optimizer = AdamW
weight_decay = 0.01

- **2e-5 LR**: Standard for fine-tuning pre-trained models
- **3 epochs**: Balances performance vs overfitting
- **Warmup**: Gradual LR increase for stable training

## 🔬 Advanced Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Attention Mechanism
```python
# The model learns patterns like:
"not good"     → Attends "not" to "good" → Negative
"very good"    → Attends "very" to "good" → Very Positive
"not bad"      → Complex negation → Slightly Positive
```

### 2. Contextual Embeddings
```python
# Same word, different meanings:
"bank" in "river bank"     → [0.2, 0.5, ...]
"bank" in "money bank"     → [0.7, -0.3, ...]
# Transformer distinguishes based on context!
```

### 3. Transfer Learning Power
```python
# Without pre-training:
- Needs millions of examples
- Trains for weeks
- 80-85% accuracy

# With pre-training (our approach):
- Needs 25K examples
- Trains in hours
- 92-94% accuracy
```

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### For Faster Training:
- Use GPU: `device = torch.device("cuda")`
- Increase batch size: `batch_size=16`
- Reduce sequence length: `max_length=256`
- Use smaller model: `bert-tiny`

### For Better Accuracy:
- Train longer: `epochs=5`
- Use full BERT: `bert-base-uncased`
- Adjust learning rate: Try 1e-5 or 3e-5
- Ensemble models

### For Less Memory:
- Reduce batch size: `batch_size=4`
- Use gradient accumulation
- Enable mixed precision training
- Use CPU: `device = torch.device("cpu")`

## 🛠️ Customization Ideas

1. **Different Datasets**
   - Twitter sentiment
   - Product reviews
   - News classification
   - Emotion detection

2. **Model Variations**
   - BERT (larger, more accurate)
   - RoBERTa (optimized BERT)
   - ALBERT (parameter efficient)
   - XLNet (autoregressive)

3. **Multi-class Classification**
   - Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Very Negative
   - Change `num_labels=5`

4. **Attention Visualization**
   - Use BertViz
   - See what model focuses on
   - Debug predictions
