## How to Run the Notebook

### Option 1: Using Jupyter Notebook

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook Sentiment_Analysis_Assignment.ipynb
```

### Option 2: Using Jupyter Lab

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Start Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab Sentiment_Analysis_Assignment.ipynb
```

### Option 3: Using VS Code

1. Open the notebook in VS Code
2. Select the Python kernel from your venv
3. Run cells sequentially with Shift+Enter

## Running the Complete Analysis

Once the notebook is open:

1. **Run All Cells**: Click `Cell → Run All` (or `Kernel → Restart & Run All`)
2. **Wait**: The complete analysis takes approximately 2-5 minutes
3. **Review Output**: All code, outputs, plots, and analysis will be displayed

## What You'll See

### Visualizations Created:
- Sentiment distribution bar chart
- Sentiment proportion pie chart
- Review length analysis
- Word count distribution
- Multiple performance metric charts
- Confusion matrix heatmap
- Feature importance plots
- Model confidence distribution

### Analysis Provided:
- Descriptive statistics
- Missing value handling
- Text preprocessing examples
- TF-IDF feature extraction
- Model training progress
- Prediction examples with confidence scores
- Performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)
- Top positive/negative sentiment words
- Comprehensive findings analysis

## Dataset Information

The notebook includes a sample dataset that simulates the IMDB format:
- 2,000 movie reviews (1,000 positive, 1,000 negative)
- Includes HTML tags (as in real IMDB data)
- Has missing values (2%) to demonstrate handling
- Realistic review text

### To Use Real IMDB Dataset:

1. Download from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews
2. Save as `IMDB Dataset.csv` in the project directory
3. In the notebook, uncomment line: `df = pd.read_csv('IMDB Dataset.csv')`
4. Comment out the sample dataset creation code

## Expected Results

With the sample dataset:
- **Accuracy**: ~95-99% (high due to clear positive/negative examples)
- **Precision**: ~95-99%
- **Recall**: ~95-99%
- **F1-Score**: ~95-99%

With real IMDB dataset:
- **Accuracy**: ~85-90% (more realistic with diverse reviews)

## Customization Options

### Adjust Dataset Size:
```python
# In the data loading section, change multiplier:
positive_reviews = [...] * 200  # Instead of * 100
negative_reviews = [...] * 200  # Instead of * 100
```

### Modify TF-IDF Parameters:
```python
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
    max_features=10000,     # Increase features
    min_df=5,               # Adjust minimum document frequency
    max_df=0.7,             # Adjust maximum document frequency
    ngram_range=(1, 3)      # Include 3-word phrases
)
```

### Try Different Models:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
```

## Troubleshooting

### If NLTK downloads fail:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('omw-1.4')
```

### If visualization doesn't show:
```python
%matplotlib inline  # Add at top of notebook
```

### If memory issues occur:
- Reduce dataset size (change multiplier from 100 to 50)
- Reduce max_features in TF-IDF (from 5000 to 2000)
