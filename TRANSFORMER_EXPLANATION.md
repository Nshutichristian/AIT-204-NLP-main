# How Transformers Work for Sentiment Analysis

## Network Issue Note
⚠️ **Current Status**: The training scripts require network access to Hugging Face to download pre-trained models. There appears to be a network connectivity issue. Once network access is restored, you can run:
```bash
python imdb_sentiment_analysis.py  # Full IMDB dataset
# OR
python imdb_sentiment_demo.py      # Demo with local synthetic data
```

## Transformer Architecture Explained

### 1. The Big Picture

The transformer architecture (from the diagram) revolutionized NLP by using **attention mechanisms** instead of recurrence. For sentiment analysis, we use the **encoder** portion of the transformer.

```
Input Text → Tokenization → Embeddings → Transformer Encoder → Classification Head → Sentiment
```

### 2. Step-by-Step Process

#### **Step 1: Tokenization**
```python
Input: "This movie was fantastic!"

# Tokenizer breaks it down:
Tokens: ['[CLS]', 'this', 'movie', 'was', 'fantastic', '!', '[SEP]']
Token IDs: [101, 2023, 3185, 2001, 11781, 999, 102]
```

- **[CLS]**: Classification token (used for final prediction)
- **[SEP]**: Separator token (marks end of sequence)
- Each word/subword gets a unique ID

#### **Step 2: Input Embedding**
```python
# Each token ID → 768-dimensional vector
Token "fantastic" (ID: 11781) → [0.23, -0.45, 0.67, ..., 0.12]  # 768 values
Token "terrible" (ID: 6659)  → [-0.56, 0.89, -0.23, ..., -0.78]
```

These embeddings are **learned** during pre-training:
- Similar words have similar vectors
- "fantastic" and "amazing" → similar vectors
- "fantastic" and "terrible" → opposite vectors

#### **Step 3: Positional Encoding**
```python
# Position information added to preserve word order
Position 0 [CLS]:     [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, ...]
Position 1 "this":    [sin(1/10000), cos(1/10000), ...]
Position 2 "movie":   [sin(2/10000), cos(2/10000), ...]
...

Final Embedding = Token Embedding + Positional Encoding
```

Why? Transformers process all words simultaneously, so they need position info.

#### **Step 4: Multi-Head Attention (The Magic!)**

This is where transformers shine. The model learns **what to pay attention to**.

**Example**: "The movie was not good"

```
Attention Weights (simplified):
         the  movie   was   not   good
the     0.1   0.2    0.1   0.1   0.1
movie   0.2   0.3    0.1   0.1   0.2
was     0.1   0.1    0.2   0.3   0.3  ← "was" attends to "not" and "good"
not     0.1   0.1    0.2   0.4   0.4  ← "not" strongly attends to "good"
good    0.1   0.2    0.2   0.4   0.3  ← "good" attends to "not"
```

The model learns:
- "not" and "good" should be processed together
- Together they indicate **negative** sentiment
- "not good" ≠ "good"

**Multi-Head Attention Formula**:
```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k) × V

Where:
Q (Query)  = "What am I looking for?"
K (Key)    = "What information do I have?"
V (Value)  = "What is my actual content?"
```

**12 Attention Heads** learn different patterns:
- Head 1: Captures negation ("not good")
- Head 2: Captures intensifiers ("very good")
- Head 3: Captures subject-sentiment relationships
- ... and so on

#### **Step 5: Feed Forward Network**
```python
# After attention, each token goes through:
FFN(x) = max(0, xW₁ + b₁)W₂ + b₂

# This adds non-linearity and refines representations
Input:  [0.5, -0.3, 0.8, ..., 0.2]  # After attention
Output: [0.7, -0.1, 0.9, ..., 0.4]  # After FFN
```

#### **Step 6: Add & Norm (Residual Connections)**
```python
# Residual Connection:
output = LayerNorm(input + Attention(input))
output = LayerNorm(output + FFN(output))

# This helps with:
# - Gradient flow during training
# - Preventing vanishing gradients
# - Stabilizing training
```

#### **Step 7: Repeat N times**
In DistilBERT:
- **6 encoder layers** (BERT has 12)
- Each layer refines the representation
- Layer 1: Basic patterns (words, syntax)
- Layer 3: Phrase-level patterns
- Layer 6: Complex semantic relationships

#### **Step 8: Classification Head**
```python
# Extract [CLS] token representation (it aggregates all information)
cls_representation = encoder_output[0]  # Shape: [768]

# Linear layer projects to 2 classes
logits = Linear(cls_representation)     # Shape: [2]
# Example: [2.3, -1.5] → [positive_score, negative_score]

# Softmax converts to probabilities
probabilities = Softmax(logits)         # Shape: [2]
# Example: [0.92, 0.08] → 92% positive, 8% negative
```

### 3. Training Process

#### **Forward Pass**
```python
Review: "This movie was fantastic!"
Label: Positive (1)

1. Tokenize → [101, 2023, 3185, 2001, 11781, 999, 102]
2. Embed    → [[0.2, ...], [0.5, ...], ...]
3. Encoder  → Process through 6 layers
4. Classify → [0.95, 0.05] ← 95% confident it's positive ✓
```

#### **Loss Calculation**
```python
# Cross-Entropy Loss
Predicted: [0.95, 0.05]
Actual:    [1.0,  0.0]   # One-hot encoded (Positive)

Loss = -[1.0×log(0.95) + 0.0×log(0.05)] = 0.05  # Low loss = good!

# For wrong prediction:
Predicted: [0.2, 0.8]
Actual:    [1.0, 0.0]
Loss = -[1.0×log(0.2) + 0.0×log(0.8)] = 1.61    # High loss = bad!
```

#### **Backpropagation**
```python
1. Calculate gradients of loss w.r.t. all parameters
2. Update weights using optimizer (AdamW):

   W_new = W_old - learning_rate × gradient

3. Repeat for all batches, all epochs
```

### 4. Why Transformers Excel at Sentiment Analysis

#### **Traditional Approach (Bag of Words)**
```python
"not good" → ["not": 1, "good": 1] → Positive??? (because "good" is positive)
# Misses the negation!
```

#### **Transformer Approach**
```python
"not good" →
  Attention connects "not" with "good" →
  Context-aware representation →
  Correctly identifies as Negative ✓
```

#### **More Examples**

**Example 1: Sarcasm (Partial Understanding)**
```
Text: "Oh great, another predictable ending"

Transformer processing:
1. "great" → typically positive
2. "Oh" + "great" → attention shows sarcasm indicator
3. "predictable ending" → negative context
4. Combined → Likely Negative (but sarcasm is hard!)
```

**Example 2: Complex Sentiment**
```
Text: "The acting was superb but the plot was terrible"

Attention patterns:
- "acting" → "superb" (positive)
- "plot" → "terrible" (negative)
- "but" → signals contrast

Final: Mixed/Negative (depending on training)
```

**Example 3: Long-Range Dependencies**
```
Text: "While the first half dragged on unnecessarily, the spectacular
       finale and emotional resolution made it all worthwhile"

Transformer:
- Attends across entire sentence
- Links "dragged" (negative) with "spectacular finale" (positive)
- "worthwhile" at end influences overall positive sentiment
```

### 5. Key Hyperparameters

| Parameter | Value | Impact |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Learning Rate** | 2e-5 | Too high → unstable; Too low → slow |
| **Batch Size** | 8-16 | Larger → faster but needs more memory |
| **Epochs** | 2-3 | More epochs → better fit but risk overfitting |
| **Max Length** | 128-512 | Longer → captures more context but slower |
| **Warmup Steps** | 500 | Gradual LR increase at start |
| **Weight Decay** | 0.01 | L2 regularization to prevent overfitting |

### 6. What the Model Learns

#### **Attention Patterns** (visualized)
```
Input: "This movie was absolutely fantastic!"

Layer 1 Attention:
- Basic word relationships
- "movie" attends to "This"
- "absolutely" attends to "fantastic"

Layer 3 Attention:
- Phrase-level patterns
- "absolutely fantastic" processed as unit
- Identifies intensifier pattern

Layer 6 Attention:
- Sentence-level semantics
- [CLS] attends to all sentiment-bearing words
- "fantastic" and "absolutely" have high weights
```

#### **Learned Representations**
```python
# After training, the model knows:

Positive indicators:
- "fantastic", "amazing", "loved", "brilliant"
- "highly recommend", "must watch"
- Exclamation marks: "Great!"

Negative indicators:
- "terrible", "awful", "waste", "boring"
- "disappointed", "don't watch"
- "I want my money back"

Negation patterns:
- "not good" → negative
- "not bad" → slightly positive
- "couldn't be better" → very positive

Intensifiers:
- "very good" > "good"
- "absolutely terrible" < "terrible"
```

4. Backward pass → gradients
5. Update weights
6. Repeat
```

#### **Inference Mode**
```python
1. Load single review (no label)
2. Forward pass → predictions
3. Return probabilities
4. No weight updates
```

### 9. Performance Metrics

```python
# Example Results (Expected):

Accuracy:  92-94%  # Overall correctness
Precision: 92-94%  # Of predicted positives, % actually positive
Recall:    92-94%  # Of actual positives, % correctly identified
F1 Score:  92-94%  # Harmonic mean of precision & recall

# Confusion Matrix:
                Predicted
                Pos    Neg
Actual  Pos    [2300   200]
        Neg    [180   2320]

True Positives:  2300
False Positives: 180
True Negatives:  2320
False Negatives: 200
```

### 10. Advantages Over Traditional Methods

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Bag of Words** | Simple, fast | No context, misses negation |
| **Word2Vec/GloVe** | Word embeddings | Static, no context adaptation |
| **RNN/LSTM** | Sequential, context | Slow, vanishing gradients |
| **Transformer** | Parallel, attention, context | Needs more data, computation |

### 11. Real-World Application Flow

```python
1. User writes review: "Best movie ever!"
2. System tokenizes input
3. Passes through trained transformer
4. Gets probabilities: [0.98, 0.02]
5. Returns: "Positive (98% confident)"
6. Action: Display with 5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```

### 12. Transfer Learning Advantage

```
Pre-training (by Google/Hugging Face):
- Trained on billions of words
- Learns English language patterns
- Understands grammar, semantics, context

↓

Fine-tuning (our task):
- Adapt to sentiment analysis
- Only needs 25k examples
- Trains in hours (not weeks)
- Achieves 93% accuracy

Without transfer learning:
- Would need millions of examples
- Would take weeks to train
- Might achieve only 80-85% accuracy
```
