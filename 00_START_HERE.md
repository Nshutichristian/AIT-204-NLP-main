## 🎓 How to Use This Project

### Self-Study Approach:
1. **Start with** `LEARNING_PATH.md`
2. **Work through** each part sequentially
3. **Complete TODOs** in the Python files
4. **Research concepts** you don't understand
5. **Check solutions** only after attempting
6. **Experiment** and make it your own!

### Learning Strategy:
- **Try first**: Attempt all TODOs before checking solutions
- **Research**: Google concepts, read docs, watch videos
- **Experiment**: Break things, fix them, learn deeply
- **Document**: Take notes on what you learn
- **Share**: Deploy your app and show it off!

### When Stuck:
1. Re-read the instructions carefully
2. Check hints in code comments
3. Review `STUDY_GUIDE.md` for concepts
4. Google the specific error or concept
5. Check `SOLUTIONS.md` for guidance (after trying!)

## 📊 Project Structure

### Part 1: Understanding Limitations (15 min)
**Goal**: See why binary classification isn't enough

Run `quick_test.py` and observe:
- ✅ "Amazing movie!" → Positive ✓
- ✅ "Terrible film!" → Negative ✓
- ❌ "It was okay" → Forced to choose Positive OR Negative

**Realization**: We need a scale, not just binary!

### Part 2: Build Multi-Scale (20-30 min)
**Goal**: Implement 7-point sentiment scale

Complete TODOs in `sentiment_scale_analyzer.py`:
1. Set num_labels = 7
2. Create training data for all 7 classes
3. Implement class_to_score conversion

**Research Topics**: Multi-class classification, label encoding

### Part 3: Create Web App (20-30 min)
**Goal**: Build user-friendly interface

Complete TODOs in `streamlit_app.py`:
1. Add title and description
2. Create text input area
3. Add result visualization
4. Include example reviews

**Research Topics**: Streamlit basics, UX design for ML

### Part 4: Deploy (15-20 min)
**Goal**: Make it public!

Follow `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Deploy on Streamlit Cloud
3. Get public URL
4. Share with the world!

**Research Topics**: Git, GitHub, cloud deployment

---

## 💡 Success Tips

1. **Don't rush**: Understanding > Speed
2. **Research actively**: Google everything you don't know
3. **Break things**: Learn by experimentation
4. **Document**: Keep notes on what you learn
5. **Be creative**: Personalize your app
6. **Share**: Show your work to others
7. **Have fun**: Enjoy the learning journey!

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Can't download model"
→ Check internet connection or use pre-cached model

### "Streamlit won't start"
→ Try different port: `streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502`

### "Stuck on TODO"
→ Read hints, research the concept, check SOLUTIONS.md if needed

### "Deployment fails"
→ Verify requirements.txt, check Streamlit Cloud logs

**More help**: See `NETWORK_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` and `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

## 🎁 Extension Challenges

After completing the main project:

1. **Add confidence threshold**: Warn if prediction is uncertain
2. **Batch processing**: Analyze multiple reviews from CSV
3. **Sentiment trends**: Plot sentiment over time
4. **Word clouds**: Visualize common words
5. **Compare models**: Try BERT vs DistilBERT vs RoBERTa
6. **Fine-tune**: Actually train on IMDB dataset
7. **Multi-language**: Extend to other languages

**Ideas**: See `LEARNING_PATH.md` and `SOLUTIONS.md`
